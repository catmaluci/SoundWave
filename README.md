# **🎧 Sound Wave - Landing Page 🎶**
Welcome to the Sound Wave project repository! This is an interactive and dynamic landing page designed to attract new subscribers to our streaming music platform. We're aiming to be a strong competitor to Spotify, offering a fresh and engaging experience. Our team was hand-picked to bring this vision to life, meticulously following a pre-existing mockup crafted by a talented UX Designer.
